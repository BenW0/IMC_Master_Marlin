Marlin is released under GPL v3 (see Marlin/COPYING for the full license), and the changes made to the Marlin source (all contained within the Marlin directory) also fall under the GPL. The IMC specification itself, however, is not dependent on any Marlin source code and is released under the MIT License. This specifically covers the IMC Framework.pdf specification document, as well as Marlin/imc_i2c_constants.h and imc_i2c_mesage_structs.h.

Again, MOST of this repository is GPL v3 (see Marlin/COPYING).

SOME of this code, as outlined above, is relased under the MIT License:
